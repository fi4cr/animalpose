# animalpose

1) Read instructions here:    
https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/jax-controlnet-sprint#data-and-pre-processing   

2) Getting a feel of the openpifpaf or deeplabcut. Running them on a range of images to find out whether we should just do a subset of animals that work well.    

3) Start to build the library of triplets (image, keypoints images, caption).    

4) Try to run things on TPU, read the docs if any issues.
